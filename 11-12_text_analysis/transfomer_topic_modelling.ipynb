Source:Supplied\\nAt least 100 homes have been lost and dozens of people have been injured so far in the unprecedented Spring bushfires .\\nFirefighters had warned they were in “uncharted territory” as they struggled to contain dozens of blazes from suburban Brisbane to the far outskirts of Sydney.\\n“At this stage, it appears at least 100 homes have been destroyed in yesterday’s bush fires,” New South Wales fire service said in an update early Saturday.\\n#SuomiNPP captured this image today of dramatic smoke from bush fires in New South Wales, Australia. These fires are introducing large amounts of smoke particles into the atmosphere, as seen in the 2nd S-NPP image.

Source:News Regional Media\\nAcross the central coast, residents took to social media to post photos and videos of smoke-laden tangerine skies and flames engulfing storeys-tall eucalypts within sight of their homes.\\nAuthorities said some of the fires were creating their own weather conditions: pyrocumulus clouds that enveloped entire towns.\\nMeanwhile, high winds flung embers and burnt debris far ahead of the fires’ front lines, depositing the dangerous detritus on the balconies and front yards of unsuspecting residents.\\nFirefighters moved from spot to spot trying to put out small fires caused by the falling debris.\\nDespite easing conditions, a prolonged drought and low humidity levels will continue to make circumstances combustible.\\nEarlier this month some of the same fires cloaked Sydney in hazardous smoke for days, giving the city a higher concentration of particles per million than cities like Bangkok, Jakarta or Hong Kong.\\nThat prompted health authorities to warn Sydneysiders with respiratory problems to avoid outdoor physical activity.\\nSwathes of Australia have gone months without adequate rainfall, forcing farmers to truck in water at exorbitant cost, sell off livestock or leave their land to lay fallow.\\nOn Wednesday, Australia’s government announced a package of low-cost loans worth around one billion Australian dollars, designed to help drought-stricken farmers struggling with the latest “big dry”.\",\n '\\\\n Chief Executive addresses the press after citywide chaos and transport disruptions \\\\n Earlier, police shoot protester leaving him in intensive care, while separately, a man is set on fire during a dispute \\\\n Chaos continues in shopping hub as a man is beaten up and a fire started on the road. Elsewhere, pockets of violence erupt. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor has addressed the press after a day of violence in which at least one protester has been shot with a live round, while another man was set on fire during a dispute, as clashes continue across the city. Commuters are facing transport chaos and disruption. Major thoroughfares across several districts have been blocked and MTR services suspended after objects were thrown onto the tracks of the East Rail line, a fire was set on a train at Kwai Fong and protesters vandalised several other stations. \\\\n The unrest follows the death last Friday of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology student Chow Tsz-lok, days after he fell in a car park near a police dispersal operation in Tseung Kwan O, where tear gas had been fired.

    "#### 1. Embeddings\n",
    "BERTopic uses a pre-trained model (similar to spacy's language models) to determine the similarity of different documents within a corpus. The BERT model is able to factor in word ordering as well as the semantic similarity\n",
    "of words into its predictions, as well as better anticipate which words within a document are the most important to conveying the sentence's meaning. In essence it looks at words within their context and makes a prediction about the which documents are similar and which are dissimilar. It expresses that using a large array of numbers called 'embeddings'. In many ways embeddings are similar to our vectors when we counted the frequency of words.\n",

    "| 2            | 1 | 1  | 1 | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0            | 0  | 0       | 0          |\n",

    "\n",
    "BERT embeddings represent each document as a row of 384 columns. This data can be used by our computational tools to find clusters of documents based on their semantic similarity, identify which documents are representative of a particular cluster etc. It is a powerful approach to topic modelling as it is aware of more than just the words used, but how they are used and the context of their usage. As such BERT embeddings are best produced using completely raw text, without any pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Topic Representation\n",
    "Seperately, BERTopic uses a variation of TFIDF to then generate keywords to represent clusters of documents found via the embeddings. By default it uses a fairly basic vectorisation and pre-processing routine. However it is also possible to pass it pre-prepared tokens (like we produced in earlier sessions) which it will happily use instead. As the embeddings are generated using the raw text, whilst our keywords are produced using pre-processed text, this means our pre-processing decisions won't impact the embeddings and actual clustering, just the quality of the words used to describe the clusters.\n",

      "text/plain": "\" Also in this package Fraud victims of Aziz Com Mirza speak out The dodgy investment schemes of Canadian-Pakistani Aziz Com Mirza ‘Serial’ entrepreneur in Dubai accused of being serial scammer Dubai officials warn about new online extortion scam 'Dead' man comes back to life to scam in Ajman Dubai: A Dubai-based expat accused of defrauding investors worldwide through a string of get-rich-quick schemes seems to have run out of luck.\\nCanadian man Aziz ‘Com’ Mirza, who lives in Burj Khalifa, drives supercars and describes himself as serial entrepreneur, mentor, influencer and philanthropist has been arrested and is now in Al Awir jail, Gulf News can confim.\\nCom, who is of Pakistani origin, was reportedly taken into custody by Bur Dubai Police on October 27 following a complaint of a UAE resident who lost over $150,000 in his dodgy schemes. A source at Dubai Public Prosecution said Mirza is being investigated for fraud and taking money from people illegally.\\nGulf News uncovered the racket In April 2019, a Gulf News investigation uncovered how Com Mirza had tricked hundreds into investing into disguised Ponzi schemes, dodgy real estate projects and a crypto currency that is now worthless.\\nThe victims include people from as far as US, UK, Canada and Greece.\\nCon Mirza Scam - How I was conned out of money - US$380,000 Supplied Most belong to a UK-based online community platform called the Muslim Entrepreneur Network (MEN) which Com Mirza and his brother Rafaqat ‘Rocky’ Mirza got associated with shortly after its launch in 2015.\\nOnce on board, the duo allegedly used the platform to float an investment scheme called the Leverage Programme (LP) which guaranteed ‘financial freedom’ within a year.\\nAziz 'Com' Mirza presenting Habibi Coin at a Leverage event in London\\nMembers were encouraged to join the network by forking out a minimum of £5,000 each.\\nEnticed by promises of attractive returns, 300 signed up in early 2017.\\nAround 1,200 more enrolled a few months later.\\nAmong new recruits was Sharjah-based Umm Rayyan who paid £25,000. “It was our life-savings,” she told Gulf News on Monday. “We were called for a meeting at a mall in Dubai where Com promised us financial freedom within one year. More than two years have passed since then and I have no clue where my money is,” said the Indian expat.\\nWho is Com Mirza? A Canadian of Pakistani origin, Aziz ‘Com’ Mirza describes himself as a serial entrepreneur, investor, social media influencer, mentor, philanthropist and dream chaser. He claims that since launching his first business at age seven with a lemonade stand, he has done business in eight countries.\\nAccording to him, he runs multiple companies in technology, real estate, automotive, luxury rental, crypto currency, investment and media industries. Com lives in Burj Khalifa and has over 800,000 followers on Instagram where the feed is filled with pictures of him enjoying hospitality of local hotels and restaurants.\\nMoney trail Nearly £4 million was raised under LP between January 2017 and 2019.\\nMost of it was wired to the bank account of a Dubai-based firm owned by a third brother of Com Mirza while huge amounts went to pay for personal expenses.\\n“Between them the brothers took millions of pounds from average people around the globe,” MEN’s co-founder Harun Rashid said in an email to Gulf News from London.\\nLong list of victims Aside from LP, scores more lost money to two other shady schemes fronted by Com Mirza — International Success Group (ISG) and a cryptocurrency called Habibi Coin, once billed as the “bitcoin of the Middle East”.\\nBriton Kalib Hussain, who invested £50,000 in ISG, said the scheme was pitched as an educational subscription website where Com was supposed to teach them how to make the most of their money.\\n“But somewhere down the line it morphed into an investment programme called ISG Capital Pool which required members to pool in their funds and get guaranteed 10 per cent returns within 12 months from a real-estate project in Dubai,” recalled Hussain.\\nNew Yorker Tariq Syed who invested $100,000 in ISG said: “Com claimed he was a real estate mogul. We believed him.”\\nDevastated Dubai-based sales manager Gulammohiyuddin Maskati, 43, said he’s devastated having burnt his fingers in ISG and the real estate-backed cryptocurrency Habibi Coin launched by Com as a Sharia compliant currency\\n“I invested $50,000 in ISG and $25,000 in Habibi,” said Mastaki, one of the many investors who have since filed a police complaint.\\nJohn Barry from USA said he invested $500,000 in a scheme after spending a week with Com and talking with people who regarded him highly.\\n“It was all an illusion,” he said.\\nIppokratis Boboras, who lives in Greece, said she invested $10,000 in Habibi Coin in 2018.\\n“I was familiar with Com Mirza through the internet marketing community where he was considered an authority. I had personal chats with him via Facebook and I sent money to his personal Paypal account,” Boboras said in an email to Gulf News.\\nGiannis, also from Greece, said he and his brother jointly invested $17,000 in Habibi after meeting Com at his Burj Khalifa apartment.\\n“He presented himself as a $500 million dollar entrepreneur,” said Giannis.\\nMohammad Shareef from UK who lost £2000 in Habibi said he didn’t invest until he visited Com at his office in Dubai and met him in person. “We spoke for an hour. It wasn’t until this year that things started going down. Com’s Instagram posts are now all about food and gym. It’s been a sad experience for us. Until today there’s been no official word about what has happened with Habibi Coin,” said Shareef.\\nCanadian Abe Arabi ($10,000), Britons Mohammad Vorajee ($2,000), Humaun Rashid (£10,000), Abdul Aim (£14,000), American Kevin Green (1,500) are among several other Habibi investors with similar stories.\\n-With inputs from Ali Al Shouk, Senior Reporter\""
